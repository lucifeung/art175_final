                        <h2>About the Designer</h2>
                        <p style="text-align: left;">
                          Phuong Ngo is a college student, majoring Digital Media Art in San Jose State University. During her time in school, she learned 3D modeling, html and java coding; so aside from digital drawing, Phuong can also do basic website design, logo design, character design, and fashion design. She is a digital illustrator that started making her earliest works mostly based on fan art and game art. In 2020, she changed her art style into semi-realism, increased her fanbase and started accepting commissions as her second part-time job. She has a good storytelling skill, and has talent in implying parable, lesson, wordplay, symbol, etc. in her artworks. Phuong really tends to include a second layer meaning behind every detail of her work of art, because she personally thinks that is how any artwork becomes a work of art - by being meaningful in the most subtle way.
