      <h2>Project Work In Progress</h2>
      <br><br><br><br><br>
      <p style="text-align: left;">
        This is a quick tour of how I used the tools in Photoshop for this project.
        <br><br>
        I mostly used Resleeve and Dall-E for generating the models. The clothing and accessories were carefully selected and added later on in the customization step with the Generative Fill feature in Photoshop. What I learned from this process is that the prompts need to be precise and concise, also the outcome will vary depending on how much area I put on selection and where I selected it. Then I added the models to the runway with Generative Expand tool. There were also some more masking and adjustment need to be done before the final version was completed.

          AI in Fashion Design: <br><br>

          Artificial Intelligence  has the potential to revolutionize the fashion industry in many ways. AI can help fashion designers in various aspects of their work, including trend forecasting, product design, and marketing.
          <br><br>
          For example, AI can be used to analyze past and future performance indicators, conduct trend forecasting for elements such as color, fabric, patterns, and cut, and create new product designs. AI can also help designers to quickly and accurately generate trend-led designs for production that are complete with sewing patterns.
          <br><br>
          Moreover, AI can provide personalized style recommendations, trend analyses, and forecasting, as well as community management on social media platforms. AI can also help fashion companies to create better-selling designs, reduce marketing costs, hyper-personalize customer communications, and speed up processes.
          <br><br>
          In the future, it’s entirely possible that generative AI, a technology comprising algorithms that can be used to create new content, including audio, code, images, text, simulations, and videos, could blend the prowess of a creative director with the power of AI, helping to bring clothes and accessories to market faster, selling them more efficiently, and improving the customer experience.
          <br><br>
          My project is to generate a fashion design brand made with the help of AI. Our AI-powered fashion designer can help creating a unique and personalized clothing that reflects one's style and personality. With AI's cutting-edge technology and my own eyes for clothing, my project can help analyze customer's preferences, body type, and fashion sense to create custom designs that are tailored to your needs. Whether you’re looking for a casual outfit or a formal dress, our AI-powered fashion designers can help you look your best.
          <br><br>
          The generated designs will then be published as a fashion week recap, as if they were produced in to clothing and made their way to a real life runway.

                        <p style="text-align: left;">
                          Phuong Ngo is a college student, majoring Digital Media Art in San Jose State University. During her time in school, she learned 3D modeling, html and java coding; so aside from digital drawing, Phuong can also do basic website design, logo design, character design, and fashion design. She is a digital illustrator that started making her earliest works mostly based on fan art and game art. In 2020, she changed her art style into semi-realism, increased her fanbase and started accepting commissions as her second part-time job. She has a good storytelling skill, and has talent in implying parable, lesson, wordplay, symbol, etc. in her artworks. Phuong really tends to include a second layer meaning behind every detail of her work of art, because she personally thinks that is how any artwork becomes a work of art - by being meaningful in the most subtle way.
