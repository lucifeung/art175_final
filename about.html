          AI in Fashion Design: <br><br>

          My project is to generate a fashion design brand made with the help of AI.  Our AI-powered fashion designer can help creating a unique and personalized clothing that reflects one's style and personality. With AI's cutting-edge technology and my own eyes for clothing, my project can help analyze customer's preferences, body type, and fashion sense to create custom designs that are tailored to your needs. Whether youâ€™re looking for a casual outfit or a formal dress, our AI-powered fashion designers can help you look your best.
          <br><br>
          The generated designs will then be published as a fashion week recap, as if they were sewn into physical pieces and made their way to a real life runway.

                        <p style="text-align: left;">
                          Phuong Ngo is a college student, majoring Digital Media Art in San Jose State University. During her time in school, she learned 3D modeling, html and java coding; so aside from digital drawing, Phuong can also do basic website design, logo design, character design, and fashion design. She is a digital illustrator that started making her earliest works mostly based on fan art and game art. In 2020, she changed her art style into semi-realism, increased her fanbase and started accepting commissions as her second part-time job. She has a good storytelling skill, and has talent in implying parable, lesson, wordplay, symbol, etc. in her artworks. Phuong really tends to include a second layer meaning behind every detail of her work of art, because she personally thinks that is how any artwork becomes a work of art - by being meaningful in the most subtle way.
